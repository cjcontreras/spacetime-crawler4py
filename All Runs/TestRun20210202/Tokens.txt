individuals propel forward the innovations that support and sustain our civilization Informatics delves into the strategy behind these innovations exposes their inner workings and blazes a trail to stunning advances in technological capability Through incisive analysis and inspired creativity informatics is the building block of a successful modern society Designing for inclusiveness Traditionally the one size fits all model of many classrooms has made it difficult to meet the needs of certain students The Department of Informatics is expanding the horizons of childhood education by creating comfortable customized experiences that adapt to children s learning styles and individual situations The emergence of innovative virtual and augmented reality platforms presents opportunities to truly personalize learning experiences especially for children with chronic health conditions or disabilities As one example we are developing learning environments for children and adults with autism that aim to increase their quality of life by supporting social and communication skills As another we are researching the use of telepresence robots to allow homebound children to attend class And more is to come with the relatively low cost of micro electronics 3D printing and VR headsets setting the stage for a dramatic change in not only how we teach kids but also how we treat patients and help families Informatics is at the forefront of exploring how best to exploit technology to reach the disenfranchised and better address the needs of all citizens Securing our cyberinfrastructure Whether it is built by an individual at home a small business or a corporate behemoth like Google technology starts as an idea Fleshing out that idea through design and development involves a multi faceted process shaped by programming challenges market competition and the ever increasing scale of the systems we create The Department of Informatics is a leader in addressing all aspects of technology production including security aspects which are essential to mitigating ever increasing risks and privacy concerns For example our faculty members are working on tools such as RevealDroid which applies a machine learning based approach to malware detection to better secure mobile apps Another example is COVERT a tool that aims to identify and address vulnerabilities created by the interaction of multiple apps With these and other cutting edge tools and approaches in security and beyond Informatics continuously seeks to push toward a safer tech enabled society Informatics

which students secure their internships What if I don t pass the technical interview for a summer internship or if I am not offered an internship The program is intended to improve students skills to help them become more confident during technical interviews If a student is still unable to secure an internship after diligent effort the student should consult with the Program and Faculty Directors

companies like Google Facebook Microsoft Amazon participate in upcoming career fairs Large tech companies will participate in upcoming career fairs but not all of them due to the high volume of student interest they receive and because of their recruitment timelines In addition to career fairs large tech companies may be on campus for other events so always be on the lookout To register for upcoming UCI Career Fairs and to see employers who will be in attendance please log into Handshake Employer events hosted by the School of ICS or by ICS Professional Programs will be in ICS CODE When should I start applying to internships When do companies start recruiting Most large tech companies will begin recruiting in Fall some as early as July but mostly late August September Smaller to mid size companies will usually start in Winter beginning as early as December January Once you have identified your target companies we recommend you visit their career university pages to find the internship postings since most of them have deadlines that you should not miss If you do not see a posting set up email notifications through their website and on job sites like LinkedIn so you are alerted right away and can apply as soon as the position is posted Regardless of when you apply the most important thing is to make sure you meet the application deadline if any We recommend you submit your application within the first two weeks of the position being posted and at least one to two weeks prior to the deadline listed If I am interested in an internship at a company should I apply directly on their website Or should I go through a recruiter Would it be harmful to apply through both If you see an internship postings on a company s website and you are confident with your application materials we recommend you apply as soon as possible Please also pay careful attention on the postings to see whether there is a deadline to apply and plan to apply at least one to two weeks prior to that deadline For larger companies anyone you talk to will likely direct you to apply on the company website including the recruiter It will not be harmful to do both However another way is to reach out to your current contacts at the company if you have any to see if they are able to make a referral before you submit your online application This way some job sites may allow you to include the employee s name as your referral Even better your contact may send your information to their seniors or managers which will help you in the entire process and increase your chances for being invited for interviews What is the typical timeline for an internship application I e once I submit my online application when should I expect a phone interview technical interview on site interview and the offer Industry research shows that on average the entire recruitment process from sourcing a candidate to hiring a candidate takes 26 business days While this timeline is mostly accurate this timeline does vary with different companies regardless of their size Some students received call backs within one week of application submission some received call backs one or even two months later The key is your follow up sometimes that makes a significant difference in how fast the process will move forward if it moves forward at all Will networking and connecting with HR recruiters increase my chances of getting hired For internship positions you will quickly learn that HR recruiters play the role of a gatekeeper ensure equal opportunities and manage a fair and consistent recruiting process for all applicants As such due to the high volume of applicants they receive an HR recruiter will most likely redirect you to apply via the company s website For full time positions however a company s recruiting process can be a bit different wherein an HR recruiter may be more responsive because they may actually be seeking you out to consider their company for employment Again this varies depending on the company and how they leverage their recruiters In all while it is good to know recruiters we encourage you focus your networking effort in connecting with actual working professionals including UCI alumni who are working or have worked at your target companies Usually these contacts can offer additional advice for you and some may have insights as to hiring needs within their teams What happens if I am unable to secure an internship First and foremost let s stay positive from the get go and approach your search with the intended result of securing an internship This mental shift will help you tremendously throughout your search That said while securing a summer internship should be a priority for all students students who do not secure internships will have an opportunity to work with faculty or a department on campus to develop a concrete software project that provides hands on experience for the student and a useful product or service to the faculty or department Who can I go to for career development and job search support As a student in an ICS Professional Master s Program you have access to a dedicated Career Development team that will provide you career development and job search support during your program Throughout the year the Career Development team will deliver career workshops that have been

diverse technologies that aim to help us navigate the world We make purchases by mobile phone bring educational software into classrooms and connect with family and friends through social media Yet we are also continuously challenged by the technologies around us in terms of their usage impact and ethical considerations Informatics studies these phenomena to help us make informed decisions and design better technological interventions as we explore the many opportunities of living in the digital age Engaging our youth Today our social lives play out across a highly intertwined web of real and virtual world interactions The implications are enormous compelling us to reimagine our understanding of interpersonal relationships and redefine our expectations of how they unfold Technology now occupies a prominent place in everything from crisis response to commerce public policy to scientific discovery and a new generation is emerging within this landscape The Department of Informatics is keeping its finger on this pulse offering key insights into evolving practices Our Connected Learning Lab for instance explores nontraditional approaches to educating and engaging K 12 students With support from the Samueli Foundation and the UCI Esports Arena it has launched a high school Esports League that leverages student interest in gaming to introduce associated curriculum in STEM domains writing and tech leadership The league is but one way in which the department engages with the world around us to ensure that the next generation has the skills needed to become effective citizens in the 21st century Navigating smart cities Digital technologies are providing new ways for us to not only connect with each other but also with the institutions that shape our lives including local government Many municipalities are excited about the possibilities offered by smart cities Sensors can provide a real time picture of life in urban space data analytics can identify emerging trends and patterns and social media can provide a new conduit for citizens to talk to government But what does it take to make this work in practice The Department of Informatics is studying how cities in Southern California deal with the pragmatics of data driven governance We are working in close collaboration with these cities to design technologies that increase civic engagement while simultaneously exploring how data focused approaches can enroll or disenfranchise certain groups of citizens Through this work we are identifying steps that cities can take to ensure equity in opportunities as they promote positive user centered living experiences Informatics brochure PDF People Contact Site Map News Feedback Privacy Policy 2021 UC Regents
