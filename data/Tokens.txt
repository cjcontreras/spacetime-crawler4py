made assuming 95 credibility levels The number of reported cases 196 843 shown as black bars in the top middle plot above underestimates the actual number of infections by a factor that ranges between 3 5 and 12 3 This means that we estimate that the total number of infections which occurred by January 06 2021 is between 695 801 and 2 424 035 We estimate that the total number of infections will be between 846 788 and 2 752 620 on February 05 2021 Prevalence number of infectious individuals at any time point is decreasing and projected to be between 23 216 and 417 964 on February 05 2021 Somewhere between 0 07 and 0 56 of all infections not cases result in death Basic reproductive number R_0 defined as the average number of secondary infections one infectious individual produces in a completely susceptible population is estimated to be between 0 6 and 2 9 Effective reproductive number R_e defined as its basic counterpart above but allowing for some fraction of the population to be removed recovered or deceased is estimated to be between 0 4 and 1 1 on January 15 2021 We want to keep R_e 1 in order to control virus transmission Note We previously created a report using a similar model with a different implementation Archives of the old report can be found here Abbreviated technical details optional Our approach is based on fitting a mechanistic model of SARS CoV 2 spread to multiple sources of surveillance data A more fleshed out method description is in the manuscript Model inputs Our method takes three time series as input daily new tests case counts and deaths However we find daily resolution to be too noisy due to delay in testing reports weekend effect etc So we aggregated binned the three types of counts in 3 day intervals These aggregated time series are shown below Past versions of model inputs 1 png Version Author Date b3e230f Damon Bayer 2021 01 12 63bcbfd Damon Bayer 2021 01 11 Model structure We assume that all individuals in Orange County CA can be split into 6 compartments S susceptible individuals E infected but not yet infectious individuals text I _ text e individuals at early stages of infection text I _ text p individuals at progressed stages of infection assumed 20 less infectious than individuals at the early infection stage R recovered individuals D individuals who died due to COVID 19 Possible progressions of an individual through the above compartments are depicted in the diagram below Past versions of model_figure svg Version Author Date dcffe20 Damon Bayer 2020 12 16 Mathematically we assume that dynamics of the proportions of individuals in each compartment follow a set of ordinary differential equations corresponding to the above diagram These equations are controlled by the following parameters Basic reproductive number R_0 mean duration of the latent period mean duration of the early infection period mean duration of the progressed infection period probability of transitioning from progressed infection to death rather than to recovery i e IFR We fit this model to data by assuming that case counts are noisy realizations of the actual number of individuals progressing from text I _ text e compartment to text I _ text p compartment Similarly we assume that observed deaths are noisy realizations of the actual number of individuals progressing from text I _ text p compartment to text D compartment A priori we assume that death counts are significantly less noisy than case counts We use a Bayesian estimation framework which means that all estimated quantities receive credible intervals e g 80 or 95 credible intervals Width of these credible intervals encode the amount of uncertainty that we have in the estimated quantities Posterior Predictive Plots Past versions of

Current Course Listings News Seminars News Seminars Center for Statistical Consulting A Campus Gem UCI s Statistical Consulting Services October 15 2020 If you re a campus researcher who hasn t yet taken advantage of UCI s statistical consulting services you re missing out on a valuable resource UCI s Center for Statistical Consulting CSC which works in collaboration with the more medical and clinical focused Biostatistics Epidemiology and Research Design BERD unit within the Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences ICTS can help address any of your data analysis needs With services such as grant proposal development sample size calculation data interpretation biostatistical education and research database design CSC BERD is your one stop shop for everything from study design to final presentation CSC BERD offers free walk in appointments for general questions or consultants can provide more in depth fee based services through hourly rates or a subscription model Hourly projects are assigned on a more ad hoc basis to currently available statisticians while the subscription model dedicates a set percentage of a statistician s or statisticians time to a department or center on campus More and more researchers are using one of these three options realizing they can take advantage of this campus gem during downtime caused by the COVID 19 lockdown There has been a significant increase in the amount of projects we ve had says Dr Joni Ricks Oddie director of CSC BERD With many unable to get into their labs they ve been dusting off old manuscripts and finally getting to that grant they ve been meaning to write Even before the global pandemic hit there was an increase in projects CSC staff worked an additional 29 hours per month in 2019 compared to 2018 and the number of BERD grants jumped from 12 to 38 with 79 of those being for the School of Medicine CSC BERD also started new internal collaborations with UCI s Conte Center and Down Syndrome Program both of which use the subscription model The advantage of this model which is only open to campus entities is that you receive dedicated and consistent support from a single statistician or a set group of statisticians says Ricks Oddie Our staff becomes long term collaborators garnering a more in depth understanding of the statistical methods research methodology and science surrounding the projects they are involved with Additionally CSC BERD has launched external collaborations with Chapman University and Rubicon Technologies bringing the total number of external clients to 10 and has hired two programmer analysts to expand its offerings One of the things that we ve realized is that beyond just the physical support a lot of researchers need help with data visualization data management of large databases things like that says Ricks Oddie so we now provide that type of support CSC BERD also leverages faculty support Because CSC is housed in the Statistics Department of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences ICS if the statisticians don t have the answer to your needs they can create it If someone comes to us with a project that requires the development of a new statistical methodology that might be beyond the skill set of one of our statisticians we can work with Professor of Statistics Babak Shahbaba and he can put us in touch with a faculty member for collaboration on the project say Ricks Oddie That s been really successful Another priority has been training We also want to make researchers feel better equipped in their own right she says Information has to be disseminated to them so that they can make sure that high quality research is going on all over campus Since she first took over as director back in 2018 she has brought on staff to develop and organize new workshops including a free Stata training series Check the website for upcoming events So whether you have a basic question about your scientific research or need in depth statistical assistance be sure to get in touch with CSC BERD Shani Murray Orange County Business Journal UCI Forecasts COVID 19 Trends in OC UCI Launches New Professional Program

individuals propel forward the innovations that support and sustain our civilization Informatics delves into the strategy behind these innovations exposes their inner workings and blazes a trail to stunning advances in technological capability Through incisive analysis and inspired creativity informatics is the building block of a successful modern society Designing for inclusiveness Traditionally the one size fits all model of many classrooms has made it difficult to meet the needs of certain students The Department of Informatics is expanding the horizons of childhood education by creating comfortable customized experiences that adapt to children s learning styles and individual situations The emergence of innovative virtual and augmented reality platforms presents opportunities to truly personalize learning experiences especially for children with chronic health conditions or disabilities As one example we are developing learning environments for children and adults with autism that aim to increase their quality of life by supporting social and communication skills As another we are researching the use of telepresence robots to allow homebound children to attend class And more is to come with the relatively low cost of micro electronics 3D printing and VR headsets setting the stage for a dramatic change in not only how we teach kids but also how we treat patients and help families Informatics is at the forefront of exploring how best to exploit technology to reach the disenfranchised and better address the needs of all citizens Securing our cyberinfrastructure Whether it is built by an individual at home a small business or a corporate behemoth like Google technology starts as an idea Fleshing out that idea through design and development involves a multi faceted process shaped by programming challenges market competition and the ever increasing scale of the systems we create The Department of Informatics is a leader in addressing all aspects of technology production including security aspects which are essential to mitigating ever increasing risks and privacy concerns For example our faculty members are working on tools such as RevealDroid which applies a machine learning based approach to malware detection to better secure mobile apps Another example is COVERT a tool that aims to identify and address vulnerabilities created by the interaction of multiple apps With these and other cutting edge tools and approaches in security and beyond Informatics continuously seeks to push toward a safer tech enabled society Informatics
